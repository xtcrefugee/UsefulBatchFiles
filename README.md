A general repository to collect various small batch files I've made that have been useful.

## raplaylist.cmd
Creates basic RetroArch playlists in the current JSON format from plain text files containing a list of roms with their full paths. Works with both Windows paths and Unix-like paths.
Requires dos2unix.exe in the current directory or in your PATH for the generated playlist to be readable by RetroArch: https://waterlan.home.xs4all.nl/dos2unix.html

For example, to create a playlist with all .sfc/.smc Super NES roms in the current directory and sub-directories:
```
dir /B /S *.s?c >"SNES.txt"
raplaylist "SNES.txt"
```
The above will generate SNES.lpl which can then be copied to RetroArch's *playlists* directory. Thumbnails and playlist icons are not required for playlists to function, but if you want them remember that they need to be named according to the playlist name chosen. In this example, thumbnails would need to go in *thumbnails\SNES\Named_Boxarts* etc. and icons need to be named *SNES.png* and *SNES-content.png* in the various folders within *assets*, depending on what UI driver you are using.

Note that rom CRCs are not generated by this script, and are not usually required. For more info on RetroArch's JSON playlist format see http://docs.libretro.com/guides/roms-playlists-thumbnails/
